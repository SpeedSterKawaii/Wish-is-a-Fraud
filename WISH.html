<h2 id="is-there-a-message">Should you purchase the cheap technology&nbsp;stuff on wish?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Wish has&nbsp;the CHEAPEST things in the world! From Phones to Clothes, they are really affordable and half the price on Amazon, eBay or Mercari. But what is the real deal? Are they scamming us? Are they really giving away the things we asked for? Well, let&#39;s talk.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a new smartphone, you can find one on wish! Wait, wait- should you buy it on wish? There are cheap fake clones such as &quot;Sumsung&quot;. Yes, not Samsung, but surprisingly &quot;Sumsung.&quot;, ePhones, it&#39;s like Wish has turned into a meme-fest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before you buy anything, or start to hate me for my opinions, do not buy&nbsp;<strong>anything</strong>&nbsp;on wish! It&#39;s a huge fake feast that you will ever find on the market. They claim to have &#39;18 MP&#39;, which is the photo quality, 1080P video recording (so that is 1080 pixels), or the video quality which most cameras have nowadays. And they claim to have custom cameras, but there are probably some cheap camcorder lenses. I&#39;m just saying wish is a huge fraud. I have no idea how they are verified because most of their tech is a big scam.</p>

<p>For example, if you purchase something on January 25th, you are expecting it to come in April or May. I wouldn&#39;t mind spending a few 50 or 100 dollars on something that comes faster and of real-deal quality. The most fake thing in Wish is the Cameras, or Gaming Gadgets. They sell &quot;PlayStation&quot; copies or clones. Claiming to have 4K HDMI output, but it&#39;s actually VGA (480W/h) which is about 1990 quality. I really &quot;WISH&quot; they shut down.</p>
